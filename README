As part of our ICS4U summative, we created a type of 'choose your own adventure' sort of game using Java played through the console or terminal. 
The objective was to create a project that would utilize a database of sorts to put our abilities of object oriented programming to the test.
The game is dubbed 'AYJ Simulator' as it takes place as a student at the high school establishment of A.Y. Jackson Secondary School, which
would let the player play as if they were a freshman student and pick their courses and fiddle around with time management. 

The game in itself takes inspiration from popular vintage 'Choose Your Own Adventure' games like Oregon Trail and modern visual novels to drive
the story line and game decision making.
However, due to time constraints, at the time of creating this game, the complexity was stunted to a basic level.

The game should be able to be run from 'GameRunner.java', which also provides instructions on how to play.
Typically, all that is needed are the files, for them to be compiled, and then typing and occasional clicking are required to play the game.
The goal of the game in the end is to finish 'high school' with a high score and ideal ending, where studying and making yourself happy to
cultivate high grades will let you have higher points. Along with this, there are also monthly events which can vary the story and are randomized.

The database of the system is how the test scores, courses, and events are stored, in which they are placed in a system akin to a database for
simple retrieval and utilization.

The game was made by Joseph Chan, William Chu, Andrew Hua, Joseph Wang and Justin Wang.
