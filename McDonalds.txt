Eat the sandwich now.
You open the bag and you smell the aroma of the fries. You take a bite of the sandwich and you think to yourself, why do I keep eating this, I'm trying to lose weight.
Eat the sandwich later.
You put the meal into your bag but the smell is too tempting so you take out a fry and eat it.
While chewing you think to yourself, is working here that bad?
