You casually look on the road and you see something furry. You don't pay much attention to it until it suddendly moves. You realize it is a cat.
2
"It's not my problem why do I care about that thing?"
The kitten looks at you with his soft gaze and you seem to get mind controlled to help him.
"He's too cute, I have have to help him right away!"
You quickly run to the kitten and take him into your arms.
He meows and seems to tell you to pet him. Do you take him home with you or do you let him go safetly on the sidewalk.
2
"Take him home and care for him forever and ever!"
He meows happily and smiles at you.
"Leave him on the sidewalk"
He meows again and your decision making skills become clouded and you take him home anyways.
Together you go back him with your newly found kitten. You find him a cardboard box and he falls asleep instantly with a smile.
