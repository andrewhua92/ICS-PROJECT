As you look out the window from your house you see this beautiful figure walking their dog. As much as you want to talk to them, you know you do not have the social skills to.

Open the door and go talk to them.
They freeze in their spot and look at you as you run towards them to talk.
Don't do anything and keep staring.
They notice you creeply staring at them and come to your window.
Them says, "Hey, I saw you looking at my dog, do you like dogs too? <3"

"Yes, I love them. They are my favourite animal."
You say, "I love dogs and taking care of them, just like I will take care of you."
"No, I am allergic to them."
You say, "Yes, your dog is super cute just like you" as you want them to love you.
Immediately you realize how desperate you sound and you cringe at your words. They pretend to not hear the last part of your sentence.

"Do you wanna go out sometime?"
They say, "Wow, people keep thinking I won't say yes just because I'm attractive but you sure have the balls! In fact yes I would."
"Can I pet your dog?"
You pet their dog and the dog seems to smile at you. They says, "Wow, my dog usually attacks who ever tries to pet them. We have a connection. Let's hang out sometime! <3"
You arrange a time for a date and you feel this warm fuzzy feeling inside. You finally have a significant other!
